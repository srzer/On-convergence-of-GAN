# On-convergence-of-GAN
Open source code of the project of Game theory.

This codebase is based on the *Deep Learning* course of IIIS. And we implement various GANs on MNIST dataset.

‘’gan.ipynb‘’ is for vanilla GAN, ‘’gan_consensus‘’ is for consensus optimization, ‘’gan_triple‘’ is for Triple GAN.
